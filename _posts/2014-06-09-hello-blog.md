title: Hello Blog

This is my first attempt at using GitHub Pages. I'm going to give this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) thing a try. I sure hope I'm doing it right.

I am constantly blown away by GitHub. It seems they have though of everything. I'm sure they'll prove me wrong soon.

I just completed [GitHub's Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and here's some cool stuff I learned.


### Emojis

There are something like 800 emojis available in GitHub's markdown. User @arvida made a big [cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).


### Closing issues via commit messages

Documented [here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages), you can close an issue by putting keywords in a commit message. An example would be "Fixes #42". You can also close an issue via a pull request.


### Issue attachments

You can put [images attachments](https://github.com/blog/1347-issue-attachments) in issue comments. Cool!
